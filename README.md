# classical-and-qml-Anomaly-Detect
Performance Analysis of classical and quantum ml model for anomaly detection
<h1>Project Overview</h1>
This project explores the performance of both classical and quantum machine learning models for anomaly detection. Using a real-world dataset from Kaggle, we apply classical ML techniques alongside emerging quantum machine learning algorithms to compare their effectiveness and computational efficiency.

The classical ML model used is Random Forest, identified as the best classical model for the dataset. Quantum models implemented include:

Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC)

Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC)

Quantum Neural Network (QNN)

The project also features a Streamlit app that showcases the classical modelâ€™s prediction results and provides insights into quantum model performance.

<h1>Dataset</h1>
The dataset used for anomaly detection is sourced from Kaggle, containing labeled data points for identifying anomalies. The data is preprocessed and split for training/testing classical and quantum models.

<h1>Key Highlights</h1>
Classical ML Model: Random Forest classifier applied to the dataset demonstrates strong predictive accuracy and robustness for anomaly detection.

Quantum ML Models: QSVC, VQC, and QNN are implemented on sample data points. These quantum models exhibit promising results and importantly, demonstrate reduced computation time compared to classical models for the given data subset.

Performance Comparison: The project highlights trade-offs between classical and quantum approaches, focusing on prediction accuracy, computational time, and scalability.

<h1>Streamlit App</h1>
An interactive app built with Streamlit visualizes anomaly detection using the Random Forest model, allowing users to test input data points and observe predictions in real-time.
